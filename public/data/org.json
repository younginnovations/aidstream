        "en": "In France, companies register through a number of institutions, predominantly the local centres de formalit\u00e9s des entreprises, but all companies must eventually be registered with the Trade and Companies Register. Once registered, companies receive a SIREN or SIRET number, which is a unique business identifier.\n\nThis information is maintained by Infogreffe. Infogreffe provide a basic overview of company information for free, and bulk download of data for a fee.\n\nA note on identifiers: \n\n- A SIRET number is constituted by the SIREN number, plus the NIC code. \n\n- The SIREN number relates to a business, whereas a SIRET number relates to a specific geographically located establishment which will be owned by a business.\n\n- \"A SIREN number is your unique French business identification number. This 9 digit number will be requested by all French administration when dealing with you.. It is a proof that you are a fully registered French business\" [1]\n\n\"The SIRET code/number is an INSEE code which allows the geographic identification of any French establishment or business.\n\nThe 14-digit number consists of three parts:\n\n- first, the SIREN code of the business (or legal unit or person) that owns the unit represented by the SIRET code,\n- second, the NIC (French: Num\u00e9ro interne de classement), is a sequential four-digit number unique to the establishment,\n- and finally, a check digit that verifies the entire SIRET number.\n\nFor example, 732 829 320 00074 would refer to the seventh establishment of the business with SIREN number 732 829 320.\" [2]\n\n\"Registration is administered by local centres de formalit\u00e9s des entreprises ( CFE), which checks your application and submits details to the relevant agencies (for a small fee). The CFE will provide you with a form M0, which is for the creation of a company.\" [3] \n\n\"Creating a company requires that it is registered with the Trade and Companies Register (RCS).\" [4] \n\n\"WHAT SOURCE IS USED FOR INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE INFOGREFFE WEBSITE?\n\nInformation concerning companies entered on the Trade and Companies Register with Registries of the Commercial Courts is taken directly from public registers held by said registries. \n\nInformation concerning companies entered on the Trade and Companies Register with other jurisdictions (district courts with commercial jurisdiction, mixed commercial courts in the overseas departments and territories) is provided by the National Industrial Property Institute (INPI).\n\nInformation concerning companies not entered on the Trade and Companies Register is taken from data on the SIRENE listing held by INSEE.\" [5]\n\n\"WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE INFOGREFFE WEBSITE?\nInfogreffe makes the following information available to the general public:\n\nFree information\n\u2022    Company search and information form\n\u2022    Key figures concerning a company\n\u2022    Implementing tracking (free alert, paid consultation).\n\u2022    Lists of articles of association and company deeds available.\n\u2022    Your formalities with online help to be incorporated on the Trade and Companies Register.\n\nPaid information\nView, download, order\" [6]\n\n[1] http://www.startbusinessinfrance.com/blog/post/tip-what-is-a-siren-or-siret-number\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIRET_code\n[3] https://www.justlanded.com/english/France/France-Guide/Business/Paperwork\n[4][5] https://www.infogreffe.com/societes/formalites-entreprise/immatriculation-entreprise.html\n[6] https://www.infogreffe.com/societes/informations-et-dossiers-entreprises/aide-faq.html#1"

The idno.md team has long envisioned to integrate other information that will be available to the public, including information on public procurement connected with companies that have won tenders over the years.\"[1]\n\nMore information about companies and their administrators / founders can be requested at the State Registration Chamber.\n\n[1] http://www.idno.md/page?id=2 (Nov, 2017)\n[2] http://www.idno.md/page?id=5 (Nov, 2017)"

This list provides a useful fall-back source of identification for government agencies and multilateral organisations involved in aid, and in some cases, for international NGOs. \n\nThe list is updated perioidically in response to demand for new entries from DAC members. \n\nUsers should note that this list is designed to identify both organisations *and* funds or programmes, and so not all entries in this list equate to legally registered organisations. \n\nThe list is available as a spreadsheet containing multiple codelists. Two can be used to construct organisation identifiers.\n\n* The **Agency** list is used to construct identifiers for aid donor and recipient government agencies. This is constructed by combining the **donorcode** and **AgencyCode**, separated with a dash. For example, XM-DAC-1-8 identifies the Austrian (1) Development Agency (8).\n \n* The **Channel codes** list is used to construct identifiers for multilateral organisations, and international NGOs for whom no other identifier is available. The 'Channel ID' should be used. For example, XM-DAC-41301 is the identifier for the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). \n\n* The **Donor** list contains donor code values referring to the donor country as a whole. To maximise consistency, donor codes should not be used unless a specific agency, government department or fund is not identified for the reporting. In all other cases codes should be published in their 'Agency' form (e.g. XM-DAC-1-8 for Austrian Development Agency, rather than XM-DAC-1). \n\nUsers should also note that some organisations exist in both the 'Channel Codes' and 'Agency' lists. As the Channel Codes list provides a cross-walk, use of the Channel Codes is preferred in these cases."

The timeliness, availability, and licensing of this data varies among all 50 states. There is no federal dataset that contains all corporate registrations. It would be possible to create a unified open registry for all US corporations (even if only via aggregation from state ones) but this does not exist at this time.\n\nAcross those states performance varies widely and in many cases data is not available in bulk, is not machine readable, is not openly licensed etc. For more detail, see the per state summary on Open Corporates.\" [3]\n\n\"The Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification.

Each 10-digit BRIDGE number is randomly generated and unique to an organization.\n\n**The country or countries that the list covers**: BRIDGE is global in scope. To date, BRIDGE numbers for organizations/entities in eight countries have been released as open data: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and United States. Data for additional countries will be released on an ongoing basis as the BRIDGE team assesses and addresses any potential data privacy and security risks of making this data publicly available.\n\n**The legal form or organizations that the list covers**: BRIDGE covers a variety of entities. Any private organization or program anywhere in the world devoted to social good can be assigned a BRIDGE number. The social sector encompasses the entire ecosystem of institutions that work to advance social good, regardless of organization type. This includes foundations, nonprofit organizations, schools, religious organizations, and companies. In addition, BRIDGE may assign numbers to individual chapters or branches of an organization, to programs (such as corporate giving programs), as well as to funds, which often essentially function as independent organizations. A BRIDGE number can be assigned to any entity, whether active or inactive, valid or fraudulent, new or old. A BRIDGE number itself conveys no information about the validity, veracity, quality, or status of an organization, including its current existence as a viable entity. It only serves to disambiguate and uniquely define records. BRIDGE does not assign numbers to individuals.\n\n"
