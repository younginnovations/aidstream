We wanted to help achieve IATI’s goals of making aid data open and transparent, and ultimately, improving outcomes and so we decided to make it as easy as possible for aid organisations to publish that very same data. AidStream simplifies the complexity associated with creating an open global standard for aid data, so that you can get on with changing the world.',
